Heart disease prediction using machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, evaluation &amp; visualizations)
# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses various machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical records.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used is the **Heart Failure Prediction Dataset**, which contains features like:
- Age
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Chest Pain Type
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- ST Depression, and more.

ðŸ“Œ You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) or upload your own CSV.
